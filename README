This is an Xcode 4 workspace containing multiple Cocos2D projects. Every time I write a new iDevBlogADay post that includes a source code project, I'll add it to this repository. Occasionally I may even update the source code to include new features not covered by the original blog post. 

Note that each project works independently from the Xcode workspace as well.

Individual source code files may list additional copyright holders and/or a deviating license. Please check the source code file's header for a possibly deviating license agreement.

In case a source code file has a header that includes my name and only my name (Steffen Itterheim) followed by the "Copyright __MyCompanyName__ xxxx. All rights reserved." statement in the next line, as in this example:
	//  Created by Steffen Itterheim on xx.xx.xx.
	//  Copyright __MyCompanyName__ xxxx. All rights reserved.
In that case please consider that file under MIT License too. This is merely an instance where I didn't clean up the header that is automatically created by Xcode.
